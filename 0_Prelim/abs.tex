% ABSTRACT
My research is related to exploring the convergence of a recently discovered mechanism of hearing loss that is not detected in normal hearing tests called auditory neuropathy and the subjective phenomenon of tinnitus, or persistent ringing in the ears.   I have assembled a collection of models into a fuller simulation of this behavior, that helps to predict the likelihood and manner of maladaptive neuroplasticity in the brain that results from auditory neuropathy and may reflect a tinnitus state in humans.
