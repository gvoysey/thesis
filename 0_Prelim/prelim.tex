% Degree year is the year the diploma is expected, and defense year is

% For each reader, specify appropriate label {First, second, third},
% then name, then title. Warning: If you have more than five readers
% you are out of luck, because it will overflow to a new page.
% Sometimes you may wish to put part of the title in with the name

%                       PRELIMINARY PAGES
% According to the BU guide the preliminary pages consist of:
% title, copyright (optional), approval,  acknowledgments (opt.),
% abstract, preface (opt.), Table of contents, List of tables (if
% any), List of illustrations (if any). The \tableofcontents,
% \listoffigures, and \listoftables commands can be used in the
% appropriate places. For other things like preface, do it manually
% with something like \newpage\section*{Preface}.

% This is an additional page (do not hand it in at the library) to print
% boxed-in title, author and degree statement so that they are visible through
% the opening in BU covers used for reports. This makes a nicely bound copy.
%\buecethesistitleboxpage

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.

% The copyright page is blank except for the notice at the bottom. You
% must provide your name in capitals.

% Now include the approval page based on the readers information

% Here goes your favorite quote.

% The acknowledgment page should go here. Use something like
% \newpage\section*{Acknowledgments} followed by your text.
\newpage
\section*{\centerline{Acknowledgments}}
\input{0_Prelim/ack}
\cleardoublepage

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

% Now you can include a preface. Again, use something like
% \newpage\section*{Preface} followed by your text

% Table of contents comes after preface
