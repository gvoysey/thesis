I would like to thank Jonathan Polimeni for cleaning up all these old
LaTeX style files and templates so that I didn't have to use Word to
write up this document. Also, I would like to thank all the CV/CNS lab
graduates for their contributions and tweaks to this organizational
scheme over the years (after many dissapointing interactions with
Martha Wellman).

This brings me to thank Martha Wellman of CAS and Brendon McDermot of
Mugar library who together uphold the stylistic and aesthetic
conventions that have been implemented in this LaTeX manuscript. Also
Sister Mary Virginia, the Thesis/dissertation coordinator of Mugar
Library, deserves some thanks as well.

Finally, I would like to thank Stephen Gildea, for the MIT sytle file
off which this current version is based, and Paolo Gaudiano for
porting the MIT style to one compatible for BU.
