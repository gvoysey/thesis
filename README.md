Improved Brainstem Modeling to Characterize the Effect of Low Spontaneous Rate Fiber Loss on Auditory Neuropathy
=====

Hidden Hearing Loss (HHL) is an emerging topic of hearing research that focuses on peripheral pathologies which leave audiometric thresholds unchanged but significantly impair threshold-independent hearing performance.  Primary among the proposed mechanisms of HHL is selective damage of low spontaneous rate (low SR) fibers of the auditory nerve (AN), yet no noninvasive quantitative measure of this mechanism yet exists in humans.

This proposed work aims to support the hypothesis that measuring changes in latency of Wave V of the Auditory Brainstem Response(ABR) can predict the magnitude of preferentially damaged contributions by low spontaneous rate fibers to the output of the auditory nerve.  While the relationship between Wave V latencies and a psychophysical measure of HHL has been recently established, current models of low-SR knockout and Wave V response do not fully account for the dynamics predicted from observed results.

We hypothesize that this modeling deficit is largely a consequence of the deficiencies of current brainstem and midbrain models, particularly those of the Inferior Colliculus  (IC) and Lateral Lemniscus (LL), where Wave V is thought to originate, and propose to rectify them. Comparisons of model results to experimental data will be performed.
