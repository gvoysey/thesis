\section{Motivation}
The variability of overall performance between normal hearing listeners, particularly in supra-threshold tasks performed in complex acoustic environments such as the cocktail party problem, has been recognized in the literature for many years.  Until recently, this variability was largely attributed to a broadly-defined ``Central Processing Disorder'' in the absence of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). The performance of the auditory periphery has been thought to be sufficiently characterized by pure tone audiometry (PTA), as well as Distortion-Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) and Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) for more detailed assessment of individual areas of the peripheral auditory system.

\section{Implication of the Auditory Periphery in Cochlear Synaptopathy}
Recently, selective deafferentiation of low spontaneous rate (low SR) fibers of the AN in the auditory periphery that do not affect audiometric thresholds have been convincingly demonstrated in mouse \citep{Kujawa2009Adding}, gerbil \citep{Furman2013NoiseInduced}, and recently, chinchilla (Liberman, unpublished); a growing body of psychophysical evidence suggests that a similar pathology occurs in humans \citep{Bharadwaj2015Individual}.  In mice, synaptic damage at the hair cell in the Organ of Corti has been observed both in response to noise with intensities sufficient to induce a temporary threshold shift (TTS), which does not permanently affect Compound Action Potential (CAP) thresholds or hair cell viability, and due to age alone in quiet \citep{Sergeyenko2013AgeRelated,Fernandez2015Aging}. This phenomenon has been variously described as ``cochlear synaptopathy''(CS)\citep{Bharadwaj2014Cochlear}, ``auditory neuropathy'', or ``Hidden Hearing Loss''(HHL).  

It is now thought that selective low-SR loss may be a hallmark of HHL \citep{Furman2013NoiseInduced,Bharadwaj2014Cochlear,Bharadwaj2015Individual,Schaette2011Tinnitus}. Consequently, it has been implicated in performance degradation in cocktail party scenarios in normal-hearing listeners \citep{Bharadwaj2015Individual,Bharadwaj2014Cochlear}.  Unlike NIHL, no objective and noninvasive measure of HHL in humans has been established.  While work is ongoing in cadaveric studies, the relationship between low-SR damage and HHL in humans has relied on inference from a combination of ABR, DPOAE, and psychometric measures, and no direct measure has yet been demonstrated that specifically implicates low-SR fiber loss as a sufficient causative factor for HHL.

\section{Human Psychophysical Tests Suggest a Diagnostic Measure}
Towards this goal of defining an objective measure of fiber loss,~\cite{Mehraei2015Individual,Mehraei2016Auditory} have performed a series of experiments that relate psychophysical performance in a tone-in-notched-noise ITD detection task to measured latency changes in ABR Wave V as a function of signal to noise ratio.  They hypothesized that the loss of low-SR/high-threshold AN fibers would contribute to a faster recovery time of the compound action potential of the AN.  In a perceptual task, this translates to higher thresholds, and faster threshold recovery. In a group of 28 normal hearing threshold (NHT) subjects, comparison of ABR data and psychoacoustic performance demonstrate a relationship consistent with an impairment in low-SR population response~\cite{Mehraei2016Auditory}.

\section{Computational Models of the Periphery are not Predictive}

While psychophysical experiments have supported the hypothesis of the importance of low-SR fibers, modeling the response of the auditory periphery, brainstem, and midbrain to the stimuli used in experiments has so far failed to produce results that are with experimental results \citep{Mehraei2016Auditory}.

\section{An Improved Modeling Approach} % (fold)
\label{sec:an_improved_modeling_approach}
This work sought to extend the modeling of the peripheral and central auditory system performed by~\cite{Mehraei2015Auditory} by creating a modeling framework that allows the direct comparison of the relative effects of leading acoustic models, with two novel modeling features also incorporated.  A framework for the design of modeling experiments that automatically incorporates permutations of model choice and model parameters was also developed to provide a simple modeling comparison tool to the research community.
