\section{Motivation}
The variability of overall performance between putatively normal hearing listeners, particularly in supra-threshold tasks performed in complex acoustic environments such as the cocktail party problem, has been recognized in the literature for many years \citep{Cherry1953Some}.  Until recently, this variability was largely attributed to a broadly-defined ``Central Processing Disorder'' in the absence of clinical Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). The performance of the auditory periphery has been thought to be sufficiently characterized by pure tone audiometry (PTA), as well as Distortion-Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAEs) and Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABR) for more detailed assessment of individual areas of the peripheral auditory system.

\section{Implication of the Auditory Periphery in Cochlear Synaptopathy}
Recently, selective deafferentiation of low spontaneous rate (low SR) fibers of the AN in the auditory periphery that do not affect audiometric thresholds have been convincingly demonstrated in mouse \citep{Kujawa2009Adding}, gerbil \citep{Furman2013NoiseInduced}, and recently, chinchilla (Liberman, unpublished); a growing body of psychophysical evidence suggests that a similar pathology occurs in humans \citep{Bharadwaj2015Individual}.  In mice, synaptic damage at the hair cell in the Organ of Corti has been observed both in response to noise with intensities sufficient to induce a temporary threshold shift (TTS), which does not permanently affect Compound Action Potential (CAP) thresholds or hair cell viability, and due to age alone in quiet \citep{Sergeyenko2013AgeRelated,Fernandez2015Aging}. This phenomenon has been variously described as ``cochlear synaptopathy'' (CS) \citep{Bharadwaj2014Cochlear}, ``auditory neuropathy'', or ``Hidden Hearing Loss'' (HHL).  

It is now thought that selective low-SR loss may be a hallmark of HHL \citep{Furman2013NoiseInduced,Bharadwaj2014Cochlear,Bharadwaj2015Individual,Schaette2011Tinnitus}. Consequently, it has been implicated in performance degradation in cocktail party scenarios in normal-hearing listeners \citep{Bharadwaj2015Individual,Bharadwaj2014Cochlear}.  Unlike NIHL, no objective and noninvasive measure of HHL in humans has been established.  While work is ongoing in cadaveric studies, the relationship between low-SR damage and HHL in humans has relied on inference from a combination of ABR, DPOAE, and psychometric measures, and no direct measure has yet been demonstrated that specifically implicates low-SR fiber loss as a sufficient causative factor for HHL.

\section{Human Psychophysical Tests Suggest a Diagnostic Measure}
Towards this goal of defining an objective measure of fiber loss,~\cite{Mehraei2015Individual,Mehraei2016Auditory} have performed a series of experiments that relate psychophysical performance in a tone-in-notched-noise ITD detection task to measured latency changes in ABR Wave V as a function of signal to noise ratio.  They hypothesized that the loss of low-SR/high-threshold AN fibers would contribute to a faster recovery time of the compound action potential of the AN. In a perceptual task, this translates to higher thresholds, and faster threshold recovery. In a group of 28 normal hearing threshold (NHT) subjects, comparison of ABR data and psychoacoustic performance demonstrate a relationship consistent with an impairment in low-SR population response \citep{Mehraei2016Auditory}.

\section{Computational Models of the Periphery are not Predictive}

While psychophysical experiments have supported the hypothesis of the importance of low-SR fibers, modeling the response of the auditory periphery, brainstem, and midbrain to the stimuli used in experiments has so far failed to produce results that are with experimental results \citep{Mehraei2016Auditory}.

Many disparate models of different stages of the subcortical auditory system have been developed and are in common use.  Among these are models of the middle ear, the auditory nerve, and the auditory processing areas of the brainstem and the midbrain.  Any given computational model of a particular area may be optimized by its authors for particular objectives that may not be shared by other models of the same area; further, the inputs required for more than one model of a given area may be dissimilar, and the outputs may also vary considerably.    Numerous projects exist to address some of these difficulties.  Among these projects are EarLab (\url{http://earlab.bu.edu}), the Auditory Modeling Toolbox (\url{http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net}), and the Cochlea modeling environment (\url{https://github.com/mrkrd/cochlea}) \citep{Rudnicki2014Cochlea}.   

To date, no project fully addresses the modeling concerns that arise during the study of the role of the precortical auditory system in HHL. Further, no project currently addresses the need to easily compare the performance and behavior of individual models as they are used to study the same problems.

\section{An Improved Modeling Approach} % (fold)
\label{sec:an_improved_modeling_approach}
This work sought to extend the modeling of the peripheral and central auditory system performed by~\cite{Mehraei2015Auditory} by creating a modeling framework that allows the direct comparison of the relative effects of leading acoustic models, with two novel modeling features also incorporated.  

A framework for the design of arbitrarily complex future modeling experiments that automatically incorporates permutations of model choice and model parameters was also developed to provide a modeling comparison tool to the research community.
