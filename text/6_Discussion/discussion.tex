\section{Consequences of percentage weighting degradation for synaptopathy} % (fold)
\label{sec:consequences_of_percentage_weighting_degradation_for_synaptopathy}
The methods used in this work to translate the IFR of one ANF of a given SR into the summed population response of the AN, as well as to model synaptopathy do not fully represent the stochastic nature of AN behavior.
