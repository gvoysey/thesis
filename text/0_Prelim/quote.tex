  We've heard a lot of models\ldots{}and heard suggested that we should take things out of our models to figure out what's important.  But in some sense, when I look at the diversity of models that have been presented so far---each of us leave \emph{out} things.  So maybe in some sense we've got a start towards that approach.\\  
  
  So I can ask this question two ways, but let me ask it this way: \emph{What should we leave in?} What's the bare minimum we should leave in as we try to understand what's important about the function of the cochlea?
